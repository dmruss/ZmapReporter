AritistList proxies copy contents on iteration
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~

When iterating over the contents of the the dynamically generated proxy lists
for the Artist-type accessors (see :ref:`Behavioural API Changes 3.5 - Axes
children combined`), a copy of the contents is made.  This ensure that artists
can safely be added or removed from the Axes while iterating over their children.

This is a departure from the expected behavior of mutable iterable data types
in Python -- iterating over list while mutating it has surprising consequences
and dictionaries will error if they change size during iteration.
Because all of the accessors are filtered views of the same underlying list, it
is possible for seemingly unrelated changes, such as removing a Line, to affect
the iteration over any of the other accessors. In this case, we have opted to
make a copy of the relevant children before yielding them to the user.

This change is also consistent with our plan to make these accessors immutable
in Matplotlib 3.7.

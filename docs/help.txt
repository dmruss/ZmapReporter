ZmapReporter 
A wrapper tool combining Zmap, Zgrab, and Nmap for network discovery, malware detection, and dataset generation.

Usage:

(r) - This will request parameters to begin a scan.  Required parameters are the port number, the sample size of IP addresses to locate, and the scan size.  The scan size is the number of IP addresses to perform malware script scanning on.  This number is limited due to the high network cost of perfroming malware scans.  Small scans are 1/5 the sample size, medium scans are 1/3 the sample size, and large scans are 1/2 the sample size.

    Parameter range:
        ports - Integer 1 - 65535.
        samples - Integer 2 - 500.
        scan size - Integer 1 - 3 

(h) - The help menu.

(e) - Exit the program.
